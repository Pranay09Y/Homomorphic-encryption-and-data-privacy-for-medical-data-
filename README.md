# Homomorphic-encryption-and-data-privacy-for-medical-data-
This project explores the use of homomorphic encryption (HE) to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive medical data during storage, sharing, and processing. Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic method that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it.
